	 * Noting some details from http://tinf2.vub.ac.be/~dvermeir/manuals/xlib/GC/manipulating.html
	 * regarding the options.
	 *
	 *    The line-style defines which sections of a line are drawn:
	 *        LineSolid       The full path of the line is drawn.
	 *        LineDoubleDash  The full path of the line is drawn, but the even dashes are filled
	 *                        differently than the odd dashes with CapButt style used where even
	 *                        and odd dashes meet.
	 *        LineOnOffDash   Only the even dashes are drawn, and cap-style applies to all internal
	 *                        ends of the individual dashes, except CapNotLast is treated as
	 *                        CapButt.
	 *
	 *    The cap-style defines how the endpoints of a path are drawn:
	 *        CapNotLast      This is equivalent to CapButt except that for a line-width of zero
	 *                        the final endpoint is not drawn.
	 *        CapButt         The line is square at the endpoint (perpendicular to the slope of the
	 *                        line) with no projection beyond.
	 *        CapRound        The line has a circular arc with the diameter equal to the line-width,
	 *                        centered on the endpoint. (This is equivalent to CapButt for
	 *                        line-width of zero).
	 *        CapProjecting   The line is square at the end, but the path continues beyond the
	 *                        endpoint for a distance equal to half the line-width. (This is
	 *                        equivalent to CapButt for line-width of zero).
	 *
	 *    The join-style defines how corners are drawn for wide lines:
	 *        JoinMiter       The outer edges of two lines extend to meet at an angle. However,
	 *                        if the angle is less than 11 degrees, then a JoinBevel join-style is
	 *                        used instead.
	 *        JoinRound       The corner is a circular arc with the diameter equal to the
	 *                        line-width, centered on the joinpoint.
	 *        JoinBevel       The corner has CapButt endpoint styles with the triangular notch
	 *                        filled.
	 *
	 *    For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), when the cap-style is applied to
	 *    both endpoints, the semantics depends on the line-width and the cap-style:
	 *        CapNotLast      thin   The results are device-dependent, but the desired effect is
	 *                               that nothing is drawn.
	 *        CapButt         thin   The results are device-dependent, but the desired effect is
	 *                               that a single pixel is drawn.
	 *        CapRound        thin   The results are the same as for CapButt/thin.
	 *        CapProjecting   thin   The results are the same as for CapButt/thin.
	 *        CapButt         wide   Nothing is drawn.
	 *        CapRound        wide   The closed path is a circle, centered at the endpoint, and
	 *                               with the diameter equal to the line-width.
	 *        CapProjecting   wide   The closed path is a square, aligned with the coordinate axes,
	 *                               centered at the endpoint, and with the sides equal to the
	 *                               line-width.
