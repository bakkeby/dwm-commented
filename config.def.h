/* This is the default configuration file for dwm. At compile time if a file config.h does not
 * exist then the default configuration file config.def.h will be copied to config.h.
 *
 * The config.h file is the user's personal configuration file that can be tailored to their
 * preferences.
 *
 * The relatively simple relationship between the two files is often misunderstood, however, due
 * to using patching tools like patch or git apply and being confused about why changes that were
 * applied to the default configuration were not applied to their personal configuration file.
 *
 * This in turn often lead to misleading recommendations to edit the default configuration file
 * instead and to delete config.h prior to compiling.
 *
 * While this may work in practice the downside of this approach is that:
 *    - personal configuration is exposed in the default configuration file and
 *    - personal configuration needs to be committed in version control and
 *    - changes to the default configuration file opens for more conflicts when applying patches
 *      as the underlying code has changed
 *
 * In general it is not complicated to work out what changes a patch makes to the default
 * configuration file and to copy those changes into the personal configuration file. Consider
 * doing a diff between the two files or simply look at the patch file to work out what has
