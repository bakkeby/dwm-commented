 * dynamic window manager is designed like any other X client as well. It is
 * driven through handling X events. In contrast to other X clients, a window
 * manager selects for SubstructureRedirectMask on the root window, to receive
 * events about window (dis-)appearance. Only one X connection at a time is
 * allowed to select for this event mask.
 *
 * The event handlers of dwm are organized in an array which is accessed
 * whenever a new event has been fetched. This allows event dispatching
 * in O(1) time.
 *
 * Each child of the root window is called a client, except windows which have
 * set the override_redirect flag. Clients are organized in a linked client
 * list on each monitor, the focus history is remembered through a stack list
 * on each monitor. Each client contains a bit array to indicate the tags of a
 * client.
 *
 * Keys and tagging rules are organized as arrays and defined in config.h.
 *
 * Some general concepts and terminology:
 *
 *    X
 *       The X Window System (X11, or simply X) is a windowing system for bitmap displays and is
 *       common on Unix-like operating systems. This provides the basic framework for a GUI
 *       environment and it handles the drawing and moving of windows as well as the interaction
 *       with a mouse and keyboard.
 *
 *    Xlib
 *       An X Window System protocol client library written in C containing functions for
 *       interacting with an X server.
 *
 *    Window
 *       A window is the graphical representation of a program. This is what you see and interact
 *       with when using your computer.
 *
 *    Window Manager
 *       A window manager is a program that is responsible for controlling the placement and
 *       appearance of windows within a windowing system. It can be part of a desktop environment
 *       or be used on its own.
 *
 *    Desktop Environment
 *       A desktop environment bundles together a variety of components to provide common graphical
 *       user interface elements such as icons, toolbars, wallpapers, and desktop widgets.
 *       Additionally, most desktop environments include a set of integrated applications and
 *       utilities.
 *
 *       Typically desktop environments provide their own window manager and come with a built-in
 *       compositor for handling transparency and special effects when moving or switching between
 *       windows.
 *
 *    Screen
 *       This can refer to a physical display, but in the context of dwm this can also refer to the
 *       visible screen space that is covered by the root window. This spans all physical monitors.
 *
 *    Monitor
 *       In the context of dwm the Monitor represents the drawable area of the screen and holds
 *       properties such as the size and position of the screen as well as per-monitor settings
 *       such as the selected layout, the position of the bar as well as a list of the clients
 *       that are assigned to the given monitor.
 *
 *    Client
 *       In the context of dwm the Client represents a window that is managed by the window
 *       manager. The client holds a series of properties such as the size and position of the
 *       window, various size restrictions, miscellaneous flags indicating state as well as
 *       references to other clients within the same workspace.
 *
 *       A set of clients is represented in form of a linked list, which means that one client has
 *       a reference to the next, and so on.
 *
 *    Layout
 *       In the context of dwm a Layout controls how clients are arranged (tiled) respective to
 *       other visible clients.
 *
 *       Most layouts have a larger "master" area where the main window(s) of interest reside and
 *       one or more "stack" areas where the remaining windows are placed.
 *
 *       Floating clients stay on top of tiled clients and remain in their floating position
 *       regardless of how other clients are tiled.
 *
 *    Workspace
 *       In the context of window managers in general a workspace is what holds (or owns) a window
 *       or a set of windows. Conceptually dwm has one workspace per monitor and controls what
 *       clients are shown on that workspace through the use of tags. Each workspace can have a
 *       different layout.
 *
 *       That dwm has workspaces generally goes unsaid due to the workspace being embedded into the
 *       monitor making it transparent to the user. If in doubt then note how the Monitor struct
 *       holds information that is unrelated to the screen space it occupies, as in it is used for
 *       more than one thing.
 *
 *       For the sake of consistency we will be referring to the monitor rather than the workspace
 *       for all upcoming text.
 *
 *    Tags
 *       In the context of dwm the visibility of clients are handled through the use of tags. In
 *       dwm the number of tags is user defined but limited to be between 1 and 32 tags. The number
 *       of tags will be the same on all monitors, but are controlled separately from monitor to
 *       monitor.
 *
 *       Multiple tags can can be viewed at the same time on a monitor, and a client can be shown
 *       on multiple tags.
 *
 *       The famous pertag patch for dwm enables a separate layout (and other options) to be set on
 *       a per tag basis. It works by keeping a record of what layout etc. is used on each
 *       individual tag. When you switch to another tag the settings for that tag is copied across
 *       to the Monitor. This creates a form of hybrid between workspaces and tags while taking
 *       away from the purity and concept behind tags.
 *
 *    View
 *       In the context of dwm a view is the presentation of clients on a per-monitor basis.
 *
 *    Bar
 *       The bar in dwm shows what tags are being viewed, what layout is used, the name of the
 *       selected client (if any) and a plain text status that will default to "dwm-<version>".
 *
 *    EWMH
 *       The Extended Window Manager Hints is an X Window System standard for communication between
 *       window managers and the windows they manage. These standards formulate protocols for the
 *       mediation of access to shared X resources. Communication occurs via X properties and
 *       client messages. The EWMH is a comprehensive set of protocols to implement a desktop
 *       environment.
 *
 *       dwm only supports a handful of EWMH properties and client messages out of the box.
 *
 *    The event loop
 *       In X everything is event driven. What this means is that when you click on a window then
 *       that will generate an event that is propagated back to the window manager via the X server.
 *
 *       The window manager tells the X server what types of events it is interested in receiving
 *       as well as what form of button or key presses the window manager is listening for.
 *
 *       When a window wants to go into fullscreen then it sends a client message event indicating
 *       its desire to go into fullscreen. When you move a mouse cursor over a window then the
 *       window manager will receive a notification that the mouse cursor crossed over from one
 *       window to another. When a new window is created the window manager will receive an event
 *       to that effect, the same goes when a window is closed.
 *
 *       When you hit the keybinding to focus on the next client then that will result in a key
 *       press event because the window manager told the X server that it was interested in getting
 *       such an event when the user hit MOD+k. When handling that event the window manager works
 *       out that it is associated with the focusstack function and calls that accordingly. When
 *       that action is complete it falls back to looking for new events to process.
 *
 *       Once dwm hits the run function every action or operation that the window manager does
 *       after that is reacting to events received by the X server.
 *
 * To understand everything else, start reading main() as that is what sets everything up before
 * entering the event loop.

 *
 * The first three fields are rule matching filters while the last three are rule options. What
 * this means is that a client window must match all of the class, instance and title filters in
 * order to get the tags mask, floating state and monitor options applied.
 *
 * If a rule filter is NULL then it does not apply (e.g. like instance and title filters above).
 *
 * Rule matching uses the strstr function to compare the rule filter to the corresponding class,
 * instance and title values for the window. The strstr function is case sensitive and checks if
 * a substring exists in another string.
 *
 * As an example if a rule has an instance filter of "st" then a client that has an instance name
 * of "Manifesto Pro" will match that rule because the instance name contains "st". Adding more
 * than one filter (e.g. class and instance) may help in these kind of situations.
 *
 * The fields, as well as the order of the fields, are determined by the Rule struct (given that
 * the type of the rules array is Rule).
 *
 *    typedef struct {
 *       const char *class;
 *       const char *instance;
 *       const char *title;
 *       unsigned int tags;
 *       int isfloating;
 *       int monitor;
 *    } Rule;
 *
 * It is worth noting that when some application windows are initially mapped they may have
 * different title, class and instance hints compared to when you run xprop on them. It may be
 * that these hints are changed by the application after dwm has checked the rules. An example
 * of this are LibreOffice programs that come through with class and instance hints of "soffice"
 * due to having a common launcher application named as such.
 *
 * One common misunderstanding when it comes to rules is that the tags mask is a binary mask
 * rather than just a number like 8 to place a client on tag 8. The reason for this is simply due
 * to convenience as all tags handling are binary masks, but also because a user may want to have
 * a rule that places a given client on both tag 5 and tag 7.
 *
 * Also worth noting that in (ANSI) C99 you can use designated initialisers to initialise a
 * structure. What this means is that you can initialise your rules like this:
 *
 *    static const Rule rules[] = {
 *       { .class = "Gimp", .isfloating = 1, .monitor = -1 },
 *       { .class = "Firefox", .tags = 1 << 8, .monitor = -1 },
 *    };
 *
 * Any fields that are not initialised will default to 0. This can be useful when using many
 * patches that add more rule filters or options.

		 *    window size. (The minimum size is not to be used in place of the base size for
		 *    this purpose.)
		 *
		 * In simpler terms if the size hints provided both a base size and aspect ratio
		 * hints, then the aspect ratio calculations should be made without taking the base

	 *    - then we to find the client prior (p) to client c

	 * The variable **tc is declared as a pointer to a pointer to variable of type Client.
	 *
	 * The Monitor struct holds a pointer *clients to a variable of type Client.

	 * If c->mon->clients point to NULL or c->mon->clients is the given client, then stop
	 * the for loop.
	 *    *tc && *tc != c

	 * If the first client was the given client, then tc will still be referring to the

	 * c->mon->clients to point to c->next.
	 *    *tc = c->next;

	 * But in the event that the given client was not the first client in the list we change
	 * tc to point to the address (&) of the pointer to the next client in the list.
	 *    &(*tc)->next
	 *
	 * When we hit the condition again we check if that next pointer points to NULL or if it
	 * points to the given client.
	 *    *tc && *tc != c
	 *
	 * If it doesn't then we keep moving the iterator from the next pointer to the next pointer
	 * rather than client to client until we find that the current next pointer refers to the
	 * given client, at which point we exit the for loop.

 *
 * When the other window overlapping it is moved then that damaged region of the window is exposed
 * (shown) to the user.
 *
 * In the context of dwm the window manager creates one window per monitor and this window is used
 * to show the bar. As such dwm is interested in knowing whether the bar window is damaged.
 *
 * If you look at the updatebars function then we indicate interest in being notified of expose
 * events by passing the ExposureMask event mask when the bar window is created.

 *     };

 * Now this function is also called by the movemouse and resizemouse functions. This has to do with
 * that dwm is a single process program and when you click and drag a window around with the mouse
 * then the process is stuck in a while loop inside run -> buttonpress -> movemouse until you
 * release the button. In other words the event loop is held up while a move or resize takes place
 * and as such status updates stop happening as an example.
 *
 * While the mouse is being moved or resized the respective function checks the event queue for
 * certain events and Expose events are one of the ones checked:
 *
 *     XMaskEvent(dpy, MOUSEMASK|ExposureMask|SubstructureRedirectMask, &ev);
 *
 * This means that if an Expose event comes in while a window is being moved around then that will
 * be caught by the movemouse function which will forward the event to this function. This is to
 * ensure that the bar is redrawn if you move a window over the bar and away again.
 *
 * For a better understanding of this try removing ExposureMask| from the XMaskEvent in the
 * movemouse function and move a window over the bar. When the window is moved away then that will
 * leave a blank area where the bar was because the bar is no longer redrawn when these expose
 * events come through.
 *
 * It is worth nothing that if you apply the alpha patch then graphics are handled differently due
 * to transparency which means that the bar window will not be damaged by another window
 * overlapping it, thus there will be no Expose events coming through.

 * using the MOD+l and MOD+h keybindings.

 * The default mfact value is 0.55 giving the master area slightly more space than the stack area.
 *

	 *                signal to the parent process. The SA_NOCLDSTOP flag means that no SIGCHLD
	 *                will occur when a child process stops or resumes, i.e. we will only
	 *                receive a SIGCHLD when the child process dies (terminates).
	 * SA_NOCLDWAIT - This flags means that in the case when a SIGCHLD is received then do not
	 *                transform the child process into a zombie process.
	 * SA_RESTART   - It is possible for a signal to arrive and be handled while a primitive I/O
	 *                operation such as open or read is waiting on an I/O device to respond. The
	 *                POSIX way of handling this scenario is to make the primitive fail straight
	 *                away with the EINTR error code. This means that POSIX applications that use
	 *                signal handlers must check for EINTR errors after calls to library functions
	 *                that can return it, and forgetting to check this is a common source of error.
	 *                BSD on the other hand avoids EINTR entirely by providing a more convenient
	 *                approach: to restart the interrupted primitive rather than making it fail.
	 *                Using this approach one do not have to be concerned about checking for EINTR
	 *                errors. The SA_RESTART flag tells the signal action handler to behave like

	 * process itself to be replaced with whatever is being executed. Consider the following
	 * scenario:
	 *
	 *    sleep 10 &
	 *    exec dwm
	 *
	 * Now let's say that this is being evaluated with a PID 1111. The script will run the command
	 * of sleep 10 as a child process running in the background (e.g. PID 3291 with parent process
	 * 1111). Then exec dwm will replace the process evaluating .xinitrc and start executing as
	 * dwm (i.e. PID 1111 is now executing dwm). The result of this is that the sleep is now
	 * (still) a child process of dwm. When that child process exists after the 10 seconds have
	 * elapsed it will result in a SIGCHLD and it will be dealt with by the sigaction handler as
	 * defined above.
	 *
	 * What's with the waitpid then? Let's consider this other scenario:
	 *
	 *    cat &
	 *    exec dwm
	 *
	 * Here the command of cat is run as a child process (e.g. PID 5183 with parent process 1111).
	 * As before the exec will replace the current process and start executing dwm. The cat process
	 * will have died before the sigaction handler was set up before so it will just end up as a
	 * defunct zombie process waiting to terminate. The waitpid here will find and deal with (i.e.
	 * ignore) any child processes that are waiting to terminate thus avoiding zombie processes.
	 *
	 * The function signature is:
	 *
	 *    waitpid (pid_t pid, int *status-ptr, int options)
	 *
	 * We pass the pid of -1 to say that we are interested in any process (as opposed to getting
	 * information on a particular process). This could also have been set to WAIT_ANY.
	 *
	 * We pass NULL for the status pointer as we do not care about looking up status information
	 * for child processes.
	 *
	 * For the options we pass the WNOHANG flag which just means that the function should return
	 * immediately instead of waiting in the event that there are no child processes found.
	 *
	 * The outer while is in case there are more than one zombie process waiting to terminate.

 * the tag(s) they are shown on are viewed or not.
 *
 * Client windows are shown top down when the are moved into view, and are hidden bottom up when
 * moved out of view.
 *
 * As an example let's say that we have a floating layout with a series of windows that are placed
 * on top of each other. The order of the clients is determined by the monitor stack where the
 * window that most recently had focus is at the top of the stack and the least recently used
 * window will be at the bottom of the stack.
 *
 * When moving client windows into view we start to move clients from the top of the stack, then we
 * call showhide again to move the next client in the stack.
 *
 * If this was the other way around then the window at the far bottom of the stack would be moved
 * into view first, then the next after that, and so on until the last window that is shown on top
 * of all the other windows is moved into view. This would give a very noticeable effect as the X
 * server would have to draw each window as they are moved in and overlap.
 *
 * When windows are shown top down then the window at the top of the stack is moved into view first
 * and the X server will not have to draw anything for any of the subsequent windows whose view is
 * obscured by the topmost window.
 *
 * The same logic applies when moving windows out of view. If we were to hide windows top down then
 * the topmost window would be moved out of view first, revealing the windows beneath it. The next
 * window would reveal more windows and so on and the X server would have to draw each window being
 * revealed. By hiding windows bottom up we avoid that as the topmost window obscures the view of
 * the windows below it until that too is moved away.
 *
 * Most window managers use the IconicState and NormalState window states for the purpose of moving
 * windows out of and into view. The iconic state means that the window is not shown on the screen
 * but is shown as an icon in the bar (i.e. it is minimised).
 *
 * In dwm the windows are merely moved out of view to a negative X position (which is determined by
 * the width of the client). In practice this means that the window is placed on the immediate left
 * of the leftmost monitor, just out of view.

	 * tags to the new bitmask. The problem with this is that the client window would now be
	 * out of view and it would not be possible to bring that client window into view again.
